# Spot Selection in Booking Form

## Overview

The booking form now includes enhanced spot selection functionality that allows users to select from available parking spots when making a booking.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Spot Loading

- Spots are loaded automatically when a parking lot is selected
- Real-time availability checking based on time selection
- Loading states to provide user feedback

### 2. Spot Information Display

- Shows spot number and type (if available)
- Displays availability status
- Shows count of available spots

### 3. Validation

- Requires spot selection before booking
- Prevents booking when no spots are available
- Clear error messages for missing selections

## API Endpoints

### Get Spots by Lot

```
GET /api/lots/:lotId/spots
```

Returns all spots for a specific parking lot.

### Get Available Spots

```
GET /api/spots/available/:lotId?startTime=HH:MM&endTime=HH:MM
```

Returns available spots for a lot, optionally filtered by time.

## Frontend Implementation

### BookingForm Component

The main booking form (`project/src/components/dashboards/forms/BookingForm.tsx`) includes:

1. **Spot Selection Dropdown**

   - Dynamically populated with available spots
   - Shows loading state while fetching
   - Disabled when no spots available

2. **Real-time Updates**

   - Refreshes available spots when lot changes
   - Re-checks availability when time changes
   - Provides user feedback on availability

3. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Validates spot selection
   - Shows appropriate error messages
   - Prevents submission without spot selection

### SpotsService

The service (`project/src/services/spotsService.tsx`) provides:

- `getSpotsByLot(lotId)` - Get all spots for a lot
- `getAvailableSpotsByLot(lotId)` - Get available spots for a lot
- `getAvailableSpotsByLotAndTime(lotId, startTime, endTime)` - Get available spots with time filtering

## Backend Implementation

### Parking Spot Controller

Added new endpoint in `server/controllers/parkingSpotController.js`:

```javascript
exports.getAvailableSpotsByLotAndTime = async (req, res) => {
  // Returns available spots filtered by availability and reservation status
};
```

### Routes

Updated `server/routes/parkingSpotRoutes.js` to include:

```
GET /api/spots/available/:lotId
```

## Usage Flow

1. User selects a parking lot
2. System fetches available spots for that lot
3. User selects a specific spot from the dropdown
4. System validates the selection
5. User completes the booking with the selected spot

## Error Handling

- Network errors are caught and logged
- Fallback to basic availability check if time-based check fails
- Clear error messages for users
- Graceful degradation when spots are unavailable

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
node test_spot_selection.js
```

This will test all the API endpoints and display the results.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Time-based Availability**: Check against existing bookings for time conflicts
2. **Spot Types**: Filter spots by vehicle type compatibility
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket updates for spot availability changes
4. **Visual Spot Map**: Show spots on a visual map interface
5. **Reservation System**: Allow temporary spot reservations
